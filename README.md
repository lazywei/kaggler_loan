## Algorithm

1. `alg_1`: Use K-means for clustering and data imputation. Use python's quantile regression for training.

## Convention

- `orig/` will contain original data from Kaggle. We won't commit these files into git.
- `common/` will contain common code (usually in R) used by algorithms.
- `python_code/` will contain python code (maintained by Mark for now).
